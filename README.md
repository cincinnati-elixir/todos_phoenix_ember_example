# TodoChannels
A very basic example using /ember-cli/ember-cli-todos with a Phoenix Framework backend.

## Getting Started

To start your new Phoenix and Ember-Cli application:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
3. Run the Ember-Cli application

```
cd client
npm install
bower install
ember s
```

Now you can visit `localhost:4200` from your browser.


## Running the Tests Suite

1. Run the test server in a shell `./bin/test-server
2. Run chrome_driver in a shell `chromedriver`
3. Run the tests `mix test`
